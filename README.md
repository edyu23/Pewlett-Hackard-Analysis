# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## **Overview of Project**
The Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis is about creating database design using Entity Relationship Diagrams(ERD). It also involves designing and managing tables while writing SQL queries to explore and manipulate data in said tables. This analysis specifically explores the number of retiring employees by titles as well as the employees eligible for the mentorship program.

## **Results**

  ##### **Summary**
      - It looks like there will be 90,398 positions that need to be filled when the 'Silver Tsunami' begins as we can see from our retiring titles table.
      - There are not enough qualified retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees as evidenced in our Shortfalls by department table. There are 1,549 eligible employees that can move up to higher positions meaning that there is a shortfall of 88,849 employees.
